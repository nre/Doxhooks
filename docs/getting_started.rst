`Please report any problems <https://github.com/nre/doxhooks/issues>`_ you have installing Doxhooks.


1. Install Python
*****************

Doxhooks requires Python 3.3 (or a newer version).

Mac and Windows users can `download Python <https://www.python.org/downloads/>`_ and install it. \*nix users can use their package manager.

.. note::

    It is unnecessary and `probably a bad idea to uninstall Python 2 <https://docs.python.org/2.7/faq/installed.html#can-i-delete-python>`_.


2. Install pip
**************

Doxhooks can be installed by pip.

pip is bundled with Python 3.4 (and newer versions). Install pip with the command:

:Mac and \*nix: ``python3 -m ensurepip``
:Windows: ``py -3 -m ensurepip``

Some \*nix distributions remove the bundled pip to a separate package.

pip is not bundled with Python 3.3. `Download the get-pip script <https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py>`_ (`get-pip.py`:file:) then install pip with the command:

:Mac and \*nix: ``python3 get-pip.py``
:Windows: ``py -3 get-pip.py``


3. Install Doxhooks
*******************

Install Doxhooks with the command:

:Mac, \*nix and Windows: ``pip3 install doxhooks``


4. Use Doxhooks
***************

Copy and paste the files from one of the `Doxhooks examples <examples>`:doc:. Run the example script (`example.py`:file:) with the command:

:Mac and \*nix: ``./example.py`` (or ``python3 example.py``)
:Windows: ``example.py`` (or ``py example.py``)
