Getting Started
###############

`Please report any problems <https://github.com/nre/doxhooks/issues>`_ you have installing Doxhooks.


1. Install Python
*****************

Doxhooks requires Python 3.3 (or a newer version).

Mac and Windows users can `download Python <https://www.python.org/downloads/>`_ and install it. \*nix users can use their package manager.


2. Install pip
**************

Doxhooks can be installed by pip.

pip is bundled with Python 3.4 (and newer versions). Install pip with the command::

    python3 -m ensurepip

pip is not bundled with Python 3.3. `Download the get-pip script <https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py>`_ (`get-pip.py`:file:) and install pip with the command::

    python3 get-pip.py

If either command fails because ``python3`` cannot be found, try the command again with ``python`` instead of ``python3``. Windows users can also try ``py`` instead of ``python3``.


3. Install Doxhooks
*******************

Install Doxhooks with the command::

    pip3 install doxhooks

If the command fails because ``pip3`` cannot be found, try the command again with ``pip`` instead of ``pip3``.


4. Use Doxhooks
***************

Copy and paste the files from one of the `Doxhooks examples <examples/examples>`:doc:. Run the example script (`example.py`:file:) with the command::

    python3 example.py

If the command fails because ``python3`` cannot be found, try the command again with ``python`` instead of ``python3``. Windows users can also try ``py`` instead of ``python3``.
